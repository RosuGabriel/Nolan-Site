            Best known for his cerebral, often nonlinear, storytelling,
            acclaimed writer-director Christopher Nolan was born on July 30,
            1970, in London, England. Over the course of 15 years of filmmaking,
            Nolan has gone from low-budget independent films to working on some
            of the biggest blockbusters ever made.
            <br /><br />
            At 7 years old, Nolan began making short movies with his father's
            Super-8 camera. While studying English Literature at University
            College London, he shot 16-millimeter films at U.C.L.'s film
            society, where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later
            use to make his first feature, Following (1998), on a budget of
            around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of
            international film festivals prior to its theatrical release and
            gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather
            substantial financing for his next film.
